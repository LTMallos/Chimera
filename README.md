# Chimera 🍏🤖

> Bridging the impossible.

**Chimera** is a revolutionary compatibility layer that allows `.ipa` (iOS app) files to run on Android devices - not through full emulation, but by dynamically replicating the iOS runtime environment.

Like a penguin in the Sahara inside a perfectly chilled dome, Chimera creates a *greenhouse* for iOS code - tricking it into feeling at home. (Epic Explainations)
