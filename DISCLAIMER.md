# ⚠️ Chimera Disclaimer

Chimera is an open-source developer tool intended for experimentation, research, testing, and app porting purposes only.

---

## 🎯 Main Purpose

Chimera was built to:

- Help Android developers who do not own iPhones translate or simulate their apps for iOS-style environments.
- Help iOS developers run their `.ipa` files in translated Android environments for testing or compatibility.
- Assist beginner developers and small teams in publishing their apps to **both ecosystems** faster and legally.
- Provide open-source API translation layers (like UIKit → Jetpack Compose, or vice versa).

Chimera exists **only** to support developers, not general users.

---

## 🚫 What Chimera Does NOT Do

- Chimera **does not** distribute `.ipa` or `.apk` files.
- Chimera **does not** allow DRM bypassing, in-app purchase spoofing, or Apple Store piracy.
- Chimera **does not** emulate iOS or simulate Apple servers.
- Chimera **does not** allow illegal or unethical behavior in any form.

---

## 👤 User Responsibility

Users must:

- Only run apps that they have developed, or **legally own and have rights to**.
- Accept full responsibility for any `.ipa` or `.apk` files they choose to use.
- Understand that Chimera does not verify ownership and cannot protect users from violating third-party app terms.
- Avoid uploading or sharing apps they don’t have permission to use.

---

## 📚 Legal Notice

- Chimera is **not affiliated with Apple Inc. or Google LLC**.
- All trademarks, brand names, and software are property of their respective owners.
- This tool exists solely to help developers **bridge ecosystems**, **not break them**.
- Chimera is an **experimental compatibility layer**, not an emulator or store bypass.

---

## 🧠 Final Word

Like the Wine project for Linux, Chimera opens up possibilities for code, without promoting unethical behavior.

If you are a developer with good intentions - **Chimera is yours to use, improve, and love**.  
If you seek to exploit or steal, **Chimera is not for you**.

Be fair. Be honest. Build something good.
